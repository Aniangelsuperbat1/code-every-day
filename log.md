### Day : April 9th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started using Django and created models. One step closer to building my own Django REST API!

**thoughts**: This week has been stressfull, with Hack Week, Project 4, getting everything ready before the job search, Twitter. But I wouldnt have it any other way. The Strongest Steel is forged the hottest fires.
