## Day 3: April 9th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started using Django and created models. One step closer to building my own Django REST API! Also continuing work on my Three.JS 3-D animation. Almost done with globe spinning.

**thoughts**: This week has been stressfull, with Hack Week, Project 4, getting everything ready before the job search, Twitter. But I wouldnt have it any other way. The Strongest Steel is forged the hottest fires.

## Day 4: April 10th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did one code challenge on CodeWars, it was a super easy one so I feel a little guilty. Worked on my ThreeJS animation project, so close to finishing! I deployed it to Netlify. I may use Netlify from now on to host my projects, it is super easy to use.

**Thoughts**: Was super stressed at the beginning of the week. Now not so much haha. I mean I am still stressed but doing small actions everyday has resulted into a almost complete project and I couldnt be happier with the result.

## Day 5: April 11th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished a code challenge on codewars! It was a level 7 KYU so I am moving on up!. Was able to add a moon to my 3D animation project! And it rotates around the earth! That was the last part of the project!

**Thoughts**: Am glad another project is done and under my belt! Now that the week is over and everything is finished, I feel completely stress free...until the next porject haha. Excited to present tomorrow(monday)

## Day 6: April 12th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Presentation of my ThreeJS Animation project went well! Was amazed to see all the other projects! Django threw such a huge curve ball today! Way too confusing to learn all in one day.

**Thoughts**: Out of the frying pan, into the fire. No break between finishing the project and getting right back into working on more code. i like it though, keeps us on our feet and is preparing us for the real development world! I do wish I had more time to solve code challenges though! They are a lot of fun!

## Day 7: April 13th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked On a lot more Django than I thought possible. From a monolith app to learning Django REST framework. Cool Stuff, cannot wait for tommorow. Was also able to get a coding challenge in! Solved a medium challenge in HackerRank. I feel accomplished.

**Thoughts**: Today was another whirlwind lesson on Django. The more you dive deeper into code, you more you realize you dont know anthing but you find the strength to want to learn!

## Day 8: April 14th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on Github Profiles and worked more on Django, learning auth and will learn to deploy to Heroku soon!

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day! Was able to learn a lot more by recognizing the patterns of Django. The initial setup for Django is quite extensive but doable if one sits down focuses.

## Day 9: April 15th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot more with Django. Learned how to deploy Django backend to Heroku! Not and easy feat. Thinking about what to do for project 4, the last project to rule them all.

**Thoughts**: The Course is almost ending. It all feels bittersweet. everyone I have met here are friends for life. I will miss these guys, more than I thought possible.

## Day 10: April 16th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed a few mock technical interviews. Did not expect the two sum problem but was glad to see actual employers use problems from leetcode. Shout out to Jordan Smith who volunteered to be the guinea pig!

**Thoughts**: Today was the last full day of classes. It is a bittersweet ending but not a forever ending, just a see you soon ending.

## Day 11: April 17th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on my final project. Trying to maintain twitter and 100 days of code. Working on coding challenges.

**Thoughts**: the last project I have to do for GA is being a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. implementing Alan AI voice assistant is proving challenging. My backend Api doesnt work, so may have to switch to an external one. All in all today was a good day. Didnt rest much, but got a lot of work done.

## Day 12: April 18th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built out the entire backend to my project four. Added firebase as well. Had no time to work on code challenges but will endeavor to manage my time better.

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day. Got my backend set up and deployed. Added firebase to my project but in the end it was not needed, if I am able to use it, that would be amazing. Maybe for auth?

## Day 13: April 19th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Getting stuck on getting data back from my backend. Working to fix that. Keep getting undefined but the backend is deployed and working on Heroku.

**Thoughts**: Today was a little rough. I am trying everything but Ala AI just wont give me back any data whatsoever. Need to ask for help or pivot to using an external API. Was not able to try any coding challenges.

## Day 14: April 20th 2021

**Today's Progress**: I am still trying to get data back from my backend. Alan Ai does not want to cooperate and time is dwindling. Was able to squeeze in a level 7 kata today!

**Thoughts**: I really don't want to use an external API but I dont want to ask for help either as help after the course will not be there

## Day 15: April 21st 2021

**Today's Progress**: Was FINALLY able to get data back from Backend with the help of Esin. I do not know how I will trouble shoot without help in the futrue haha. Was also able to get a hacker rank code challenge under my belt. It was a super super simple one. Just needed to use a format string.

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day. Was able to finally start making big moves on project 4, now that I can get data back from my backend. Just thinking about stretch goals and what I can do from here!!!

## Day 16: April 22nd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Was able to add more functionality to the Alan AI app. Almost done with the project!

**Thoughts**: This last project seems so long and short at the same time. Maybe because I know everything is coming to and end soon and I want to savor every moment before it does. We all have come so far! I am so proud of each and eveyone of us and cannot wait to meet everyone in person.

## Day 17: April 23rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Most functionality is done for my project! just need to add styling. The bane of my existence. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a little tough, there were serveral bugs that annoyed me and took time to track down and fix. My backend broke, then the code on the react app broke and finally deploying the front end broke. Was able to get everything fixed in the end so all was good!

## Day 18: April 24th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Deployed my project to Netlify. Trying to add some more stretch goals and make it pretty.

**Thoughts**: Today was less intense than any other. Was able to relax more and just think what else can be added to the project.
