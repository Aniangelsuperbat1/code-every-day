## Day 3: April 9th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started using Django and created models. One step closer to building my own Django REST API! Also continuing work on my Three.JS 3-D animation. Almost done with globe spinning.

**thoughts**: This week has been stressfull, with Hack Week, Project 4, getting everything ready before the job search, Twitter. But I wouldnt have it any other way. The Strongest Steel is forged the hottest fires.

## Day 4: April 10th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did one code challenge on CodeWars, it was a super easy one so I feel a little guilty. Worked on my ThreeJS animation project, so close to finishing! I deployed it to Netlify. I may use Netlify from now on to host my projects, it is super easy to use.

**Thoughts**: Was super stressed at the beginning of the week. Now not so much haha. I mean I am still stressed but doing small actions everyday has resulted into a almost complete project and I couldnt be happier with the result.

## Day 5: April 11th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished a code challenge on codewars! It was a level 7 KYU so I am moving on up!. Was able to add a moon to my 3D animation project! And it rotates around the earth! That was the last part of the project!

**Thoughts**: Am glad another project is done and under my belt! Now that the week is over and everything is finished, I feel completely stress free...until the next porject haha. Excited to present tomorrow(monday)

## Day 6: April 12th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Presentation of my ThreeJS Animation project went well! Was amazed to see all the other projects! Django threw such a huge curve ball today! Way too confusing to learn all in one day.

**Thoughts**: Out of the frying pan, into the fire. No break between finishing the project and getting right back into working on more code. i like it though, keeps us on our feet and is preparing us for the real development world! I do wish I had more time to solve code challenges though! They are a lot of fun!

## Day 7: April 13th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked On a lot more Django than I thought possible. From a monolith app to learning Django REST framework. Cool Stuff, cannot wait for tommorow. Was also able to get a coding challenge in! Solved a medium challenge in HackerRank. I feel accomplished.

**Thoughts**: Today was another whirlwind lesson on Django. The more you dive deeper into code, you more you realize you dont know anthing but you find the strength to want to learn!

## Day 8: April 14th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started to work on Github Profiles and worked more on Django, learning auth and will learn to deploy to Heroku soon!

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day! Was able to learn a lot more by recognizing the patterns of Django. The initial setup for Django is quite extensive but doable if one sits down focuses.

## Day 9: April 15th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot more with Django. Learned how to deploy Django backend to Heroku! Not and easy feat. Thinking about what to do for project 4, the last project to rule them all.

**Thoughts**: The Course is almost ending. It all feels bittersweet. everyone I have met here are friends for life. I will miss these guys, more than I thought possible.
