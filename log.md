**Today's Progress**: Finished some code challenges in Python! Working on my Three.js project! It wants to be difficult and not render.

### Day 3: April 9th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started using Django and created models. One step closer to building my own Django REST API! Also continuing work on my Three.JS 3-D animation. Almost done with globe spinning. 

**thoughts**: This week has been stressfull, with Hack Week, Project 4, getting everything ready before the job search, Twitter. But I wouldnt have it any other way. The Strongest Steel is forged the hottest fires.

### Day 4: April 10th 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did one code challenge on CodeWars, it was a super easy one so I feel a little guilty. Worked on my ThreeJS animation project, so close to finishing! I deployed it to Netlify. I may use Netlify from now on to host my projects, it is super easy to use. 

**Thoughts**: Was super stressed at the beginning of the week. Now not so much haha. I mean I am still stressed but doing small actions everyday has resulted into a almost complete project and I couldnt be happier with the result.
