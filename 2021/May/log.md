### Day 27: Monday May 3rd 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did not do much. Need to go back to leetcode and challenges.

**Thoughts**: I do not know what is wrong but I am still not working as hard as I can. I think I want everything to be perfect before I start applying for jobs but its never going to be perfect. I need to get my head in the game.
